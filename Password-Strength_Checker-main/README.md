# 🔐 Password Security Checker

**A clean and modern password strength checker built by Alok Kumar — Student at Lovely Professional University (LPU)**

This project analyzes the strength of your password in real time using the popular `zxcvbn` library by Dropbox. It estimates how long it would take a hacker to crack your password, checks for common vulnerabilities, and gives a fun tip “from an unknown hacker” to make it more interactive.
